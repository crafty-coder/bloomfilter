# Bloom-Filter Kata
Based on CodeKata Kata05: Bloom Filters (http://codekata.com/kata/kata05-bloom-filters/)

Bloom filters are a 30-year-old statistical way of testing for membership in a set. They greatly reduce the amount of storage you need to represent the set, but at a price: they’ll sometimes report that something is in the set when it isn’t (but it’ll never do the opposite; if the filter says that the set doesn’t contain your object, you know that it doesn’t). And the nice thing is you can control the accuracy; the more memory you’re prepared to give the algorithm, the fewer false positives you get

Bloom filters are very simple. Take a big array of bits, initially all zero. Then take the things you want to look up (in our case we’ll use a dictionary of words). Produce ‘n’ independent hash values for each word. Each hash is a number which is used to set the corresponding bit in the array of bits. Sometimes there’ll be clashes, where the bit will already be set from some other word. This doesn’t matter.

To check to see of a new word is already in the set, perform the same hashes on it that you used to load the bitmap. Then check to see if each of the bits corresponding to these hash values is set. If any bit is not set, then you never loaded that word in, and you can reject it.

The Bloom filter reports a false positive when a set of hashes for a word all end up corresponding to bits that were set previously by other words. In practice this doesn’t happen too often as long as the bitmap isn’t too heavily loaded with one-bits (clearly if every bit is one, then it’ll give a false positive on every lookup).
